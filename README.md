The Final Project for Advanced Machine Learning.

Here is the abstract from the associated report:

In this report we aim to explore the efficacy of countermeasures that have been implemented against COVID-19 between January 2020 and September 2021. We employ Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Mixture Density Networks (MDN) and Distributed Gaussian Processes (DGP) to learn the reproductive number $R_t$. The efficacy of policies is measured by estimating their effect on $R_t$ via a baseline comparison, permutation importance and knockout evaluation.

The resulting models fit well to the data. The MLP is able to generalise well using a product ansatz. The MDN and DGP deliver accurate fits and good generalisation. The efficacy of individual policies is in general accordance with [1] and [2].

Facial coverings are among the most effective policies, whereas contact tracing is among the most countereffective. Public information campaigns are among the policies with the least effect.
